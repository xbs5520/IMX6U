# What SPI is?



SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a **high-speed, full-duplex, master–slave protocol**. It’s designed for fast communication between microcontrollers and peripherals like displays, flash memory, sensors, and DACs.

## **Key wires:**

- **MOSI** (Master Out, Slave In) → data from master to slave
- **MISO** (Master In, Slave Out) → data from slave to master
- **SCK** (Serial Clock) → clock generated by master
- **CS / SS** (Chip Select / Slave Select) → one per slave, active low

So unlike I²C, which shares two wires for everyone, SPI usually dedicates one CS line per slave.

## How it works

1. Master pulls a slave’s CS low to select it.
2. Master generates clock pulses on SCK.
3. On each clock cycle:
   - Master sends a bit on MOSI.
   - Slave simultaneously sends a bit on MISO.
4. After the transfer, master pulls CS high to deselect.

**Full-duplex**: data flows in both directions at the same time

| Feature    | SPI                                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Speed      | Very fast (10s–100s MHz)                                    |
| Wiring     | More wires (MOSI, MISO, SCK, CS per slave)                  |
| Addressing | None in protocol; each slave has CS line                    |
| Complexity | Simple protocol, just shifting bits                         |
| Use case   | High-speed ADC/DAC, displays, SD cards, flash memory        |
| Weak spots | Pin-hungry for many slaves, no standardized error detection |

**I²C** = polite, slow, everyone on the same bus, needs addressing

**SPI** = fast, direct, each slave gets a private line, no addressing
